# Zephyr-HOWTOs
Some HOWTOs in Zephyr RTOS that I would like to share 
## smp_svr
A minimally configured smp_svr sample that enables MCUBoot with secondary slot in external SPI NOR flash.

## standalone_api
A minimally configured hello_world sample that calls GPIO related function from a custom api.
